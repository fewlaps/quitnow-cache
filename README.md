# [QuitNow](http://quitnowapp.com)'s cache
A temporary cache for JVM applications.

Before this library, caching data for a limited time was a hard task to do. The developer had to save the last time the data was stored, and then, check it everytime the data was read. So, we decided to return the work to the open source community by writing this really simple cache, allowing developers to keep information for a limited time.

We've done it using TDD, so it's totally tested. [Check the tests!](https://github.com/Fewlaps/quitnow-cache/tree/master/src/test/java/com/fewlaps/quitnowcache) :Â·)

The sample
----------

```java
QNCache cache = new QNCache.Builder().build();

cache.set("key", "value", 60 * 1000); // It can store things for a minute,
cache.set("key", "value", 60 * 60 * 1000); // for an hour,
cache.set("key", "value", 0); // or forever.
cache.set("key", "value"); // And also for the short version of forever.

cache.get("key"); // It can get them again,
cache.remove("key"); // and remove it if you want.

cache.get("unexistingKey"); // If something doesn't exist, it returns null
cache.get("tooOldKey"); // The same if a key is too old

cache.clear(); // You can also clean it,
cache.size(); // and ask it how many elements it has

QNCache<String> stringCache = new QNCache.Builder().build(); // You can also make it typesafe
stringCache.set("key", 42); // so this won't compile :)
```

Let's talk about the memory
---------------------------
By default, the cache stores a reference to all stored instances, doesn't matter if they're fresh or not. If you plan to store huge instances, like an Android's Bitmap, you can create it with an auto releaser. Then the cache will remove the old elements after the given amount of time.

```java
new QNCache.Builder().autoReleaseInSeconds(1).build(); // frees the memory every second
new QNCache.Builder().autoReleaseInSeconds(60).build(); // frees the memory every minute
new QNCache.Builder().autoReleaseInSeconds(60*60).build(); // frees the memory every hour
new QNCache.Builder().build(); // never frees the memory

```

By the way, if you use the auto releaser, you should know that you can stop it. You should do it when your Servlet container notifies you that it wants to finish the application. It's the same you should do with any database connection, for example. In Android environments you can avoid it, but you might be interested in [this extended explanation](https://github.com/Fewlaps/quitnow-cache/releases/tag/v3.2.0).

```java
cache.shutdown();
```

Are the keys case sensitive?
---------------------------
By default, yes. But you can specify it at building time.

```java
new QNCache.Builder().caseSensitiveKeys(true).build(); // "key" and "KEY" will be different items
new QNCache.Builder().caseSensitiveKeys(false).build(); // "key" and "KEY" will be the same
new QNCache.Builder().build(); // "key" and "KEY" will be different items
```

It's possible to change the default keepalive?
---------------------------
Of course! But, again, you have to specify it at building time.

```java
new QNCache.Builder().defaultKeepaliveInMillis(1000).build(); // a keepalive of one second
new QNCache.Builder().defaultKeepaliveInMillis(1000 * 60).build(); // a keepalive of one minute
new QNCache.Builder().build(); // the default keepalive: remember it forever!
```

Why working with millis and seconds?
---------------------------
Good question! If you prefer to work with TimeUnit, you're free to do it.

```java
new QNCache.Builder().autoRelease(2, TimeUnit.HOURS).build();
new QNCache.Builder().defaultKeepalive(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES).build();
cache.set("key", "value", 42, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```
